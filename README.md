Small models can be guided using library like [`outlines`](https://github.com/outlines-dev/outlines). 

This make them MUCH MUCH more reliable for function calling. This unlocks a new world of possibilities. 

This repo tries to evaluate the improvement provided by [`outlines`](https://github.com/outlines-dev/outlines) for small models on the gorilla leaderboard.
